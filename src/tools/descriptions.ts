  repo_project_brief:
    "Use this when the user asks to understand, onboard into, plan work for, summarize, or start a daily planning session for an approved repository. Prefer this as the first planning tool because it returns bounded project signals without reading the whole repo.",

  repo_write_codex_task:
    "Use this when the user explicitly asks to write a Codex prompt/task/run into the repo for Codex to execute later. Writes only .chatgpt/codex-runs/<run_id>/PROMPT.md and run.json through repo write policy; does not implement, stage, commit, push, or run Codex.",
  repo_codex_review:
